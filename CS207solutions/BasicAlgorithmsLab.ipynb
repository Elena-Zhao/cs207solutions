This is because we need to push frames on the stack, but because we'll evaluate stuff depth first, one side of the tree at a time, the maximum depth we will ever go to will come on the left side of the tree and is N. The time complexity is really bad because we always recalculate the n-1 th and n-2 th fibonacci number. It is a dastardly $2^n$ (a tighter bound is the golden ratio raised to n). It is not tail recursive as the last operation is a sum (remember the evaluation of an expression is done by evaluating the sub-expression first, followed by the operator on the values of the subexpressions)."

    ">Dynamic programming is a technique for efficiently implementing a recursive algorithm by storing partial results. The trick is seeing whether the naive recursive algorithm computes the same subproblems over and over and over again. If so, storing the answer for each subproblems in a table to look up instead of recompute can lead to an efficient algorithm. Start with a recursive algorithm or definition. Only once we have a correct recursive algorithm do we worry about speeding it up by using a results matrix. Dynamic programming is generally the right method for optimization problems on combinatorial objects that have an inherent left to right order among components. nents. Left-to-right objects includes: character strings, rooted trees, polygons, and integer sequences."
